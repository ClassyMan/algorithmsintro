Coming back to this it's actually pretty simple when you look at it in terms of
psuedo code. You have the Array, you have the target, the start and the end.

VTES:

Validate,
target,
evaluate,
shift

You first validate i.e. start <= end
Find the mid by averaging the start and end
Find the value for the mid, is it equal to the target? If so return
Otherwise start looking at the portion of the array it might be in, excluding
the mid.

Parts of a binary search algo:

Pre-processing:

Sorting before searching is always going to be more performant but for a bin search it is necessary. The algorithm depends on the order to determine the next search section.

Binary search: Divide search space in half after each comparison

Post processing:

Determine viable candidates in remaining space
