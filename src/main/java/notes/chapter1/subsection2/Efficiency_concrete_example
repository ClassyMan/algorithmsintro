Problem: Sort 10 million numbers
 - Each number is an 8 byte integer
 - 80 Megabytes for all the numbers

Computer A: 
- 10 billion instructions a second
- Programming language: Machine code
- Efficiency: 2n^2

Computer B: 
- 10 million instructions a second
- Programming language: Some high level 
  language with an inefficient compiler *shifty eyes* is this a dig at java lol?
- Efficiency: 50n * log(n)

Results: 

To sort 10 million numbers: 

Computer A: 

2(10^7) instructions / 10^10 instructions per second = 

20,000 seconds (More than 5.5 hours)

Computer B: 

50 * 10^7 lg(10^7) instructions / 10^7 instructions per second = 1163 seconds (< 20 minutes)

Merge sort wins.
