Parts of a binary search algo: 

Pre-processing: 

Sorting before searching is always going to be more performant but for a bin search it is necessary. The algorithm depends on the order to determine the next search section. 

Binary search: Divide search space in half after each comparison

Post processing: 

Determine viable candidates in remaining space
