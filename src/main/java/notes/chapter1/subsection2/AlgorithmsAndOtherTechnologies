Algorithms and other technologies

The previous examples show us that we should think of algorithms as a technology. 

Especially as they can be more potent in improving performance than actual hardware!

The main point here is that algorithms are used basically anywhere you start using software. 

- Want to sort ANYTHING?
- Want to use anything other than machine language? You'll need a compiler, interpreter 
  or assembler. Uh ooooh. 
- Want to use hardware or networking? Yup
 etc etc
