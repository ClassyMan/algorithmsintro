Efficiency

Different algorithms can be devised to solve the same problems: 
- Searching
- Sorting

etc etc 

They differ wildly in their efficiency. 

Differences can actually outweigh the technology in terms of both: 
- Hardware
- Programming language/version etc

The first examples in chapter 2 compare 
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort 

Efficiencies of these two algorithms: 

- Insertion sort: c1 * n^2
- Merge sort: c2 * n log(n)

log(n) here is log with base 2. 

There is a really good complexity chart here to visualize all this.
